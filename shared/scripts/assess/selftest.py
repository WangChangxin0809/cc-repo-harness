"""Prove the assessment can still tell a good repository from a bad one.

    python3 assess/selftest.py [--verbose]

    0 = every case held    1 = a case failed    2 = cannot run

## Why an assessment needs this more than a gate does

A gate that stops working is loud: the thing it guarded breaks. An assessment
that stops working is silent and worse than silent, because it keeps printing
numbers. A probe that has quietly gone blind reports a repository as safe, and
the report is indistinguishable from the report on a repository that is safe.

So every case here builds a repository with a known answer and insists the
probe finds it. Half of them build a repository that must score *badly*: a
measurement that cannot go down has not measured anything, and two of the
defects below were live in this tree when these cases were written --
`probe_repo.py` reported this repository's own gates as absent, and reported an
always-on skill cost of zero while an installed plugin was spending about eight
hundred tokens a turn. Both are cases here now.
